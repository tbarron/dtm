## 1.0.0 ... 2019-10-12 13:15:12

 * Added CHANGELOG.md to dtm project.

## 0.0.4 ... 2019.1012 05:42:52

 * Added version.py as the single point of truth for dtm version info and
   as an entry in py_modules in setup.py. This works. When it was not in
   py_modules, installation failed when setup.py tried to import version.
 * Added ability to query dtm version (dt().version() or dt.version()).
 * Added ISO format "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" to default parseable date/time
   formats for the dt constructor. The source string may optionally have a
   final 'Z'. Added tests for this functionality.
 * Added support for dt(epoch=<number>). Added test for this.

   objects (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=)
 * Add id names to parametrized tests
 * Add detailed descriptions of the major dt object methods
 * Describe what dtm adds to datetime
